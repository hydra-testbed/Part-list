# HYDRA Testbed repository

The dissemination of Microcontrollers, such as Arduino and Intel Galileo board, in research field, permits to reproduce control techniques for testbed of real systems such as power supply plant or water distribution system.

The water distribution testbed HYDRA, realized in the MCIP Lab in Roma Tre University, is an example of model of Cyber Physical System (CPS).

The water distribution testbed reproduces the behaviour of a water distribution system, taking into consideration all the main components of the system: a reservoir, industrial users, residential users, sewage treatment component, and fungus for the big water reserve. The testbed is also equipped with actuators (pumps) and sensors (flow sensors and pressure sensors).

Various control strategies are implemented over the microcontrollers.

One of these, with an high abstraction level, is applied to control the presence of the necessary water quantity to satisfy the user and industrial requests. Also impact factors relative to water absence are considered in order to apply the best control strategy.

Moreover fault detection strategies are adopted, based on the well known schema composed by the model and the residuals evaluation.

Requirements for students and collaborators: Background in automatic control and system modelling; basic skills in the use of recording SW for real time applications (LabVIEW) or/and data processing (MATLAB) and programming microcontrollers.
